# CREATE A MEMORY GAME

## Brief

Build a simple single-player memory game inspired by Simon. Check out this short video and Wikipedia entry to understand the rules of the game
Provide details in your README.md of the logic you have used to build your game as well as an explanation of how you tested your logic

## Technologies Used And Features

1. Built with HTML, CSS and Javascript - JQuery
2. Bootstrap 4 Framework


## Testing
Manual testing was undertaken for this application and satisfactorily passed. Tests were conducted as follows: 
1. Unit testing - Tested small chunks of the code as I progressedto ensure the code is functioning
2. Integration testing - Tested combinations of units to ensure new code doesn't interfere with existing code
3. Acceptance testing â€” Tested the application in sevreal different browsers and devices to analyze the performance of the entire application.
4. Code which was credited, was tested as the example given, then modified for desired outcome


## Design
Website layout was implemented with Bootstrap 4.0 and custom styled with CSS. I ditched the usual Simon Says format and decided I wanted a glowing-neon look with seperate rings that were positioned using Bootstrap 4 grid system.

## Deployment
You can see the application [here]().

### Media
* Audio was taken from "chiptape.com" - they were just going to be place holders but finding the type of sound to represent the look I was going for turned out more difficult then I originally anticipated

### Acknowledgments
* Resources - Codedrops, Stackoverflow, W3Schools.com, Boostrap, JQuery
* Glowing Rings - A Designer & Frontend Developer named Gautam Naik provided me the look on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50276145/creating-ring-shaped-buttons-in-css)
